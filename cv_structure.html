                            Hi! I’m Edoardo, I’m studying Data Science at the University of Milano Bicocca. I have gotten my bachelor’s degree in Statistic, and I have been in Norway for a year doing the Erasmus. During this period, I worked in a restaurant as a part-time job, it was a hard environment but, in the end, it was impossible not be attached to the people I have met at the workplace. I will keep this experience for the rest of my life. 
                            I love sports, I practice Judo since I was child and I have attended some Aikido classes.
                            I have some work experiences thanks to the several internships I have done since I was in the high school. I have worked in the accountability for TaxiBlu (https://www.taxiblu.it/) , LTA Advisory (http://www.ltaa.it/) and M9 S.p.A (https://www.m9partner.it/). While I was in M9, for my thesis, I have written a web scraping program to get data from a marketplace of apartments. My goals are open an association to help teenagers in to find their own path, be economically independent to have the possibility to travel more and keep studying data.
